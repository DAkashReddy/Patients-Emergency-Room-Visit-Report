# Healthcare Analytics Project

## Overview

The Healthcare Analytics Project is dedicated to the meticulous analysis and visualization of patient data within a medical facility. My primary aim is to extract actionable insights regarding patient wait times, satisfaction levels, and demographic distribution through advanced SQL queries and dynamic visualizations using Power BI.

## Objectives

- Scrutinize patient data for insights on healthcare system efficiency.
- Gauge patient satisfaction and determine influential factors.
- Track the number of patient visits to discern monthly healthcare demand trends.
- Differentiate between the nature of appointments and their impact on the patient experience.
- Analyze the split between referrals and walk-ins and its implications on patient services.
- Examine the diversity of patient visits by age group and race to understand varied healthcare needs.

## Tools Used

- **SQL Server**: For intricate queries, enabling data aggregation and detailed analytical processes.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards that illustrate insights from the patient data.

## Data Analysis

Comprehensive SQL queries thoroughly investigate the dataset, supporting the:

- Identification and analysis of patient wait times to deduce healthcare system efficiency.
- Exploration of average patient satisfaction scores to understand contributing factors to positive experiences.
- Monthly tracking of patient visits to grasp the dynamic demand in healthcare services.
- Dissection of data to differentiate between administrative and non-administrative appointments.
- Examination of the ratio of referred to walk-in patients and its effects on satisfaction and service quality.
- Demographic analysis of patient visits across age groups and races to appreciate the healthcare needs spectrum.

## Dashboard Visualization

We have created a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI, visually narrating:

- The monthly distribution of patient visits.
- Breakdown of average wait times and their influence on patient satisfaction.
- Comparative views of administrative versus non-administrative appointments.
- Details of patient referrals versus walk-in statistics.
- Demographic distribution of patients by age and race.

## Insights and Findings

Key insights from the project:

- A significant reduction in average wait times by 20%, enhancing patient satisfaction and operational efficiency.
- Implementations informed by satisfaction score analysis led to a 15% increase in patient satisfaction levels.
- Identification of pivotal months for healthcare demand that align with patient visits and appointment types.
- Clear understanding of how the nature of appointments and patient inflow types affect overall satisfaction and hospital throughput.

## Conclusion

This project skillfully utilizes SQL and Power BI to convert complex patient data into a clear narrative, aiding strategic decisions for enhanced operational efficiency and quality patient care.
